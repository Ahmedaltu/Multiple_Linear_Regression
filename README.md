# Multiple_Linear_Regression

In this project i used multiple linear regression to find the relation betweeen two dependent variables
the Height and Weigth for both males and females.  



I haved used in this project:  
Linear regression algorithms by python and   
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Scipy libraries.




The implemention include:  
Testing the data. 
Devide between males and females. 
Visulize the distribution of both genders. 
Find the regression cofecients and equation. 
Test and evaluate the solution.
